Single, self-supporting trunk: Trees generally have a single, self-supporting trunk, but there are instances of multi-trunked trees as well. This aspect of the definition could be improved. Provides habitat, oxygen, and resources to various organisms and ecosystems: While true, this part of the definition is focused on the ecological role of trees rather than their inherent characteristics. A more concise definition would focus on the features that distinguish a tree from other plants.  How can the definition be more concise and focused on the intrinsic characteristics of a tree? Can multi-trunked trees be better addressed in the definition? Are there other essential characteristics of a tree that should be included in the definition?
